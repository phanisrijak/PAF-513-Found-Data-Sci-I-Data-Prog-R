# Introduction

This lab provides the code to replicate the following [NYT Graphic](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/03/29/sports/baseball/Strikeouts-Are-Still-Soaring.html?_r=0&ref=baseball) using the core R `graphics` package.

# Lahman Data

These baseball data come from the `Lahman` package, which contains `Teams` - 
seasonal stats for each team.

<br>

```{r}

library(Lahman)
data(Teams)                               # Load 'Teams' dataset

```

<br>

## Previewing Teams Data

We can view the first few rows of `Teams` with function `head()`.

<br>

```{r}

head(Teams)

```

<br>

## Preprocessing

Summary statistics required for this graphic are calculated as follows. 

**Note:** *The years in the dataset exceed the years shown in the NYT graphic and require filtering or plotting limits.*

<br>

```{r}

team_stats <- Teams %>%
  mutate(avg_strikeouts = SO / G) %>%
  filter(yearID >= 1900 & yearID <= 2012) %>%
  group_by(yearID) %>%
  summarise(league_average = mean(avg_strikeouts, na.rm = TRUE))

```

<br>
<br>

# Replication

The following recreates the NYT graphic as closely as possible.

**Note:** *You may replicate the graphic step-by-step or in a single code chunk.*

<br>

## 1. Average Strike-Outs by Year

The following establishes plot dimensions and specifies x- and y-axis variables. 

```{r}


Teams %>%
  filter(yearID >= 1900 & yearID <= 2012) %>%
  mutate(avg_strikeouts = SO / G) %>%
  with(plot(yearID, avg_strikeouts, 
            type = "p", 
            xlab = "Year", 
            ylab = "Average SO", 
            xlim = c(1900, 2012), 
            ylim = c(0, 9)))
  
```

<br>
<br>

## 2. Point Color, Size, & Shape

The following additional code builds on the previous plot to specify point color, size, and shape.

```{r}
Teams %>%
  filter(yearID >= 1900 & yearID <= 2012) %>%
  mutate(avg_strikeouts = SO / G) %>%
  with(plot(yearID, avg_strikeouts, 
            type = "p", 
            col = "gray85",  # Color
            pch = 16,        # Shape
            cex = 0.75,      # Size
            xlab = "Year", 
            ylab = "Average SO", 
            xlim = c(1900, 2012), 
            ylim = c(0, 9)))

```

<br>
<br>

## 3. Full Replication

The following code replicates the NYT graphic in its entirety.

```{r}

team_stats <- Teams %>%
  mutate(avg_strikeouts = SO / G) %>%
  filter(yearID >= 1900 & yearID <= 2012) %>%
  group_by(yearID) %>%
  summarise(league_average = mean(avg_strikeouts, na.rm = TRUE))

plot(team_stats$yearID, team_stats$league_average, 
     type = "p", 
     xlim = c(1900, 2012), 
     ylim = c(0, 9),
     xlab = "Year", 
     ylab = "Average SO",
     col = "gray85", pch = 16, cex = 0.75)

lines(team_stats$yearID, team_stats$league_average, col = "blue", lwd = 2)

      side = 3, line = 0.5, cex = 0.9)
abline(h = 0:9, col = gray(0.9), lty = 2)

text(1924, 2.7, "2.7\n1924\nLeague Avg", cex = 0.8)
text(2012, 7.5, "7.5\n2012\nLeague Avg", cex = 0.8)

historical_events <- data.frame(
  year = c(1917, 1945, 1969, 1973, 1995),
  event = c("U.S. joins\nWWI", "WWII ends,\nplayers return", 
            "Mound height\nreduced in 1969", 
            "DH rule\nintroduced", "Steroids investigation\n(Mitchell Report)"),
  y_pos = c(0.5, 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6)
)

for(i in 1:nrow(historical_events)) {
  segments(historical_events$year[i], 0, historical_events$year[i], historical_events$y_pos[i], col = gray(0.7), lty = 2)
  text(historical_events$year[i], historical_events$y_pos[i], historical_events$event[i], pos = 4, cex = 0.7)
}

text(1965, 2, "Strike zone enlarged\nfrom 1963-68", cex = 0.7)


```
